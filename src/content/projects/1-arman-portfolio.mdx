This project is for Arman Ahmadi who is a backend engineer based in Amsterdam. He shares about the backend engineering world alongside personal lifestyle. I recommend to subscribe to his newsletter as he shares expertise with the community.

When I was a junior developer, he always wanted me to grow and has always been a good friend and motivator to me. I have learnt a lot from him and his expertise. Once, he told me that:

> We cannot wait for something to happen to us. It is us who will make it happen by just working a bit toward it every day.

## Mobile first design

I developed this project with a mobile-first design approach, ensuring the application was responsive to all platforms and viewports.
