One of the key advantages of Tailwind CSS is its promotion of reusable components. Which is now a standard in the front-end world. By using pre-defined classes, Tailwind allows developers to create reusable components that can be easily used throughout the codebase.

We have [contributors](https://github.com/BrianRuizy/covid19-dashboard/graphs/contributors) from all over the world ‚Äì‚ÄìSpain, Poland, India, and various places in the USA‚Äì‚Äì who came together to create something useful and meaningful. Furthermore, the site has accumulated over 10k visits as shown by web analytics. And, the project is still being maintained and improved upon, thanks to the help of developers.

## Data Sources

A large portion of the data comes from one of the original data repositories tracking COVID-19 cases, [Johns Hopkins University](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19) CSSE2019-ncov data repository. Additional data was collected from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) GitHub data repository. Lastly, to fill in some requirements we retrieved data for daily cases from [New York Times](https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data) COVID GitHub data repository.

For this project, it was crucial to have accurate, and trustworthy datasets.
This explains why the multiple aforementioned sources were diligently picked.
In doing so the goal is to provide the most accurate representations of the pandemic, the opposite could have its own repercussions at scale.

As you can see in the code above, **we can add functionalities dynamically to our objects without changing the class.**

Continuing with the weather theme here, let's create a reusable card component that can be used to display the current weather for a list of cities. With Tailwind, you can style your HTML elements without having to write any CSS rules. This can save you a lot of time, especially if you are working on a large project. Then when you need to reuse this, you don't have to go look for the `styles.css` file and copy it to a new location.

### 1. Web scraping with Pandas üêº

Here we defined a simple function that reads from a specific URL that contains a CSV of raw data, we convert it to a Pandas data frame and return it.

```python showLineNumbers {5}
import pandas as pd

def confirmed_report():
  # Returns time series version of total cases confirmed globally
  df = pd.read_csv('https://raw...CSSEGISandData/...csv')
  return df
```

**In software engineering, software design patterns are common solutions for common problems.** Is it a piece of code? Of course, NOT! It could be a description or template which can be used in many different situations to solve a problem.

Some people may ask, ‚ÄúWhy should we use them?‚Äù the answer is, ‚ÄúBecause design patterns are both **optimized and reusable**.

They were generally grouped into three categories:

- [creational patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creational_pattern)
- [structural patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_pattern)
- [behavioral patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavioral_pattern)

### Conclusion

Some of you might ask, ‚Äò‚ÄôWell, we can use inheritance instead‚Äô‚Äô You must be careful with inheritance because you may extend a class in which you don‚Äôt need all its functionalities.

Thank you for reading this and please don‚Äôt hesitate to write your comments.
