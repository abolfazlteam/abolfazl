An economic enterprise is an independent, private or non-governmental legal entity that, by providing specialized services and targeted support, accelerates the process of transforming individuals and teams with plans and ideas into businesses with products or services (acceptable by investors) and, in return for these actions, shares in the benefits of the products or businesses created.
