This project was one my favorite one. Full of challenges and cooperations with my team. It is a platform in which employers can submit their job positions and employees can go through those jobs and apply for the ones that catch their attention. Not to mention that both employees and employers need to have an account. Authentication and form validations were a challenge that I took the responsibility and handled it. Not only had to show client side validations but also having a structure that makes the forms show the backend validation error messages.

Here you can see some photos of the project:
