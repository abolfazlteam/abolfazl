I've always enjoyed using what other people created with their imagination to help us code while we enjoy the colorful lines of the dark screen. One day, it came to my mind that how fun this product will be. So, I decided to build my own custom theme which uses high contrast colors as well as not harming the eyes while looking at the screen.

So, here is how AstroBloom came to live. Theme is enjoyable to work with and does not make your eyes feel tired.

Thank you for reading so far. Just get in touch with me using my email for projects. Do not forget to install the theme and enjoy coding.
