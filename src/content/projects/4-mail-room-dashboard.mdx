This project is an admin panel for companies inside Pardis Technology Park which can do everything related to their bureaucracy such as sending mails, archiving letters or event track the letters that were created.

I was the one who take the lead of this project and completely responsible for its progress and delegate tasks to my team members. I really love this project. I ensured everything works just fine by writing e2e tests using cypress.
