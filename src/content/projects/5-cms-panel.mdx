This project is a base CMS for our websites. On top this we developed different CMSs for other projects with different requirements. It was challenging to handle different modules and managing to scale it whenever we wanted. We had some base modules and UI components in the base CMS project, and other CMSs were going to be built on top of this one. So, we decided to fork from the base repository and manage those common tasks and parts.

Here, you can take a look at some part of its UI and pages.

These ones were related to the main page of the panel.

## File Manager

The panel should had a file manager withing itself that users with different roles could have upload, zip, unzip or even download or delete files and folders. This itself was a huge and separate project itself but we did it within the CMS project as users needed that with high-quality and good timing.

Here, you can see other parts of the CMS's modules like companies module. The users could see the companies in a table with their statuses. They could edit the info of the target company, and do other CRUD operations as they needed. Here are some pictures related to them:
